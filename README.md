# catchment-shielding

This repository contains Matlab scripts used to generate Figures 3-5 in DiBiase (2018)

ShieldingWrapperScript.m: Script for reproducing the model as described in the main text, and generates the model results for Figures 3, 4, and 5

SkylineFunction.m: Function for calculating skyline shielding integration limit as a function of azimuth

IntensityFunction.m: Function for calculating the normalized radiation flux as a function of slope position and depth below the surface
